Finding and testing video players and streaming services with correct streams is one thing but finding invalid streams to test how the service behaves in these scenarios is a complete different thing and can be more challenging. To facilitate this we have developed the Eyevinn Stream Corruptor and we invite you to a closed beta to try it out.

The Stream Corruptor is a proxy that is placed in-between the streaming application and the streaming origin and manipulates the stream and adds errors to test how the service behaves. One use case is to test how the video player reacts to in-stream failures and another use case is to verify that the QoE analytics you collect are correct. For example to ensure that in-stream failures are reported correctly.

We value your feedback and invites you to try this out and to see whether this is something that could be incorporated into your development and deployment environment. By trying it out you make no commercial commitment and we are only interested in your feedback.
